# Smart Room Availability System

## Project Overview  
The Smart Room Availability System monitors room availability in real-time, allowing users to easily check if rooms—such as study spaces or meeting areas—are occupied or free. This system improves room utilization efficiency and saves time by providing up-to-date occupancy information via a simple web interface.

## Objective  
Create a system using Raspberry Pi and motion sensors to monitor and display the real-time availability of rooms in a building through a user-friendly web interface.

## Key Features  
- **Motion Detection:** Uses motion sensors connected to a Raspberry Pi to detect room occupancy.  
- **Real-Time Data Processing:** Processes sensor data instantly to determine if rooms are occupied.  
- **Web Interface:** Provides a simple web page where users can view current room availability by refreshing the page.  
- **Network Communication:** Ensures continuous and secure data flow between motion sensors, Raspberry Pi, and the web server.  
- **Scalability:** Designed to monitor multiple rooms and scale across buildings, managing increasing data volumes efficiently.

## Benefits  
- **Convenience:** Offers immediate room availability updates, saving time and aiding user planning.  
- **Efficiency:** Enhances space utilization by providing accurate, real-time occupancy information.  
- **Educational Value:** Combines hardware interfacing, software development, and real-time data management, giving practical experience with network communication and secure data handling.

## Technologies Used  
- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi, motion sensors  
- **Software:** Python (scripting), HTML/CSS (web interface), Node.js or Python Flask (backend to manage sensor data and serve web pages)

## Application  
Ideal for educational institutions, libraries, or office buildings where managing room occupancy and availability is essential.
